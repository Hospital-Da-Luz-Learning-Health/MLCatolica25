# Project assignment

You are expected to apply the knowledge acquired in this course in the form of a ML project that is due on the ??th July. In this project, you are expected to train a machine learning model that can predict a clinical outcome measure. The final deliverables are: 1) a report, 2) a presentation, 3) the code produced. This document introduces the dataset to explore and sets the outline of both the report and the presentation.

## The data set

The dataset includes over 4,240 records, with 15 attributes and a target. The goal of the dataset is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future (CHD) coronary heart disease.

## Machine Learning Prediction Project Outline

1. Introduction:
   1. **Objective**: Define the prediction task and the goal of the project.
   2. **Dataset Description**: Provide a brief description of the dataset, including the source and the type of data.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   1. **Initial Exploration**: Perform basic statistics to understand the data.
   2. **Visualizations**: Remember to use tables and plots to help you communicate interesting patterns in data
   3. **Correlations**: Confirm and report if you have linearly dependent variables in the dataset
3. Model Selection:
   1. **Model Types**: Discuss different types of machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.) and their suitability for the task.
   2. **Baseline Model**: Start with a simple model to establish a baseline performance.
4. Model Training:
   1. **Data Splitting**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   2. **Training**: Train multiple models on the training data.
   3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use techniques like grid search or random search to optimize model parameters.
5. Model Evaluation
   1. **Metrics**: Choose appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
   2. **Validation**: Use cross-validation to assess model performance.
   3. **Model Comparison**: Compare the performance of different models.
6. Model Interpretation
   1. **Feature Importance**: Identify the most important features in the best-performing model.
   2. **Model Insights**: Provide insights based on the model's predictions.
7. Conclusion
   1. **Summary**: Summarize the key findings and results of the project.
   2. **Limitations**: Discuss any limitations encountered during the project.
   3. **Future Work**: Suggest possible improvements or next steps.
8. Documentation and Presentation
   1. **Report**: Prepare a comprehensive report detailing each step of the project.
   2. **Presentation**: Create a presentation to showcase the project findings.

## Tips for Students
1. **Reproducibility**: Ensure that all code and analyses can be reproduced by others.
2. **Clarity**: Write clear and concise code with comments.
3. **Visualization**: Use visualizations effectively to communicate insights.
